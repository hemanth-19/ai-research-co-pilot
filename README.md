# ai-research-co-pilot
This project is called **AI Research Co-Pilot**. It is a simple tool that helps users upload research papers in PDF format and ask questions about them in plain English. The system reads the content of the PDF, finds the most relevant parts using smart search (FAISS with sentence embeddings), and gives a clear answer using a language model from Hugging Face. The app is built using LangChain for handling the logic, SentenceTransformers for understanding the document, and Gradio to create an easy-to-use web interface. It's useful for students, researchers, or anyone who wants quick and accurate answers from large PDF files.
